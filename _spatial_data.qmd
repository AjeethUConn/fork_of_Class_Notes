## Handling Spatial Data with GeoPandas and gmplot

The following section was written by Thomas Schittina, a senior majoring in 
statistics and minoring in mathematics at the University of Connecticut.

This section focuses on how to manipulate and visualize spatial data in Python, 
with a particular focus on the packages GeoPandas and gmplot. We'll start with 
GeoPandas and do the following:

+ Cover the core concepts and functionalities
+ Walkthrough an example using the NYC shape data

For gmplot we will:

+ Talk about why you'll need a Google Maps API key
+ See some of the different plotting functionality 
+ Walkthrough an example using the NYC shape data

### GeoPandas

#### Introducing GeoPandas

Founded in 2013, GeoPandas is an open-source extension of Pandas that adds 
support for geospatial data. GeoPandas is built around the `GeoSeries` and 
`GeoDataFrame` objects. Both are subclasses of the corresponding Pandas 
objects, so they should feel familiar to those who have used Pandas before.

#### A Remark about Shapely

The package Shapely is a core dependency of GeoPandas that handles geometric 
operations. Each geometry (point, polygon, etc.) stored in a `GeoDataFrame` is 
a Shapely object, and GeoPandas internally calls Shapely methods to perform 
spatial analysis. You won't often need to interact directly with Shapely when 
using GeoPandas. Still, you may want to familiarize yourself with its basic 
concepts.

Shapely Documentation can be found 
[here](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

#### GeoSeries and GeoDataFrame

GeoSeries:

+ Similar to `Series`, but should exclusively contain geometries
+ `GeoSeries.crs` stores the Coordinate Reference System information

GeoDataFrame:

+ May consist of both `Series` and `GeoSeries`
+ May contain several `GeoSeries`, but only one *active* geometry column
    + Geometric operations will only apply to the active column
    + Accessed and manipulated with `GeoDataFrame.geometry`
+ Otherwise similar to a normal `DataFrame`


### Example using NYC MODZCTA Shapefile

Given a file containing geospatial data, `geopandas.read_file()` will detect 
the filetype and create a `GeoDataFrame`.

```{python}
import geopandas as gpd

# read in data
gdf = gpd.read_file(
    'MODZCTA_Shapefile/geo_export_ee695ff3-2f0f-4588-ad67-208ab5af8feb.shp'
)
gdf.drop(columns=['label', 'zcta'], inplace=True)

gdf.head()
```

It's very important to know which CRS your geospatial data is in. Operations 
involving distance or area require a projected CRS (using feet, meters, etc.). 
If a geographic CRS is used (degrees), the calculations will likely be wrong.

```{python}
print(gdf.crs)

# convert to projected CRS
gdf = gdf.to_crs(epsg=3857)

print(gdf.crs)
```

Originally, the geometries were in EPSG 4326, which is measured by latitude and 
longitude. In order to work with the shape data, the CRS was converted to EPSG 
3857, which uses meters.

Now we can start working with the spatial data. First, let's compute the area 
of each zip code and store it as a new column.

```{python}
# create column of areas
gdf['area'] = gdf.area
gdf.head(3)
```

Our active geometry column is the shape data for each zip code, so `gdf.area()` 
only acts on that column and ignores the others.

Let's also find the boundary of each zip code, as well as its geographic center.

```{python}
# create columns for boundary and centorid info
gdf['boundary'] = gdf.boundary
gdf['centroid'] = gdf.centroid

gdf[['modzcta', 'boundary', 'centroid']].head(3)
```

Suppose we want to find the distance between two centroids. The current active 
geometry column is the shape data. Run `gdf.geometry = gdf['centroid']` to 
switch the active geometry.

```{python}
# switch active geometry to centroid info
gdf.geometry = gdf['centroid']
```

Then we can calculate the distance between the first two centroids with 
`distance()`.

```{python}
# find distance between first two centroids
gdf.geometry[0].distance(gdf.geometry[1])
```

#### Plotting with GeoPandas

GeoPandas also includes some basic plotting functionality. Similar to Pandas, 
`plot()` will generate visuals using matplotlib.

```{python}
# plot NYC zip codes with color mapping by area
gdf.geometry = gdf['geometry'] # must switch active geometry back first
gdf.plot('area', legend=True)
```

Interactive maps can also be generated using `explore`, but you will need to 
install optional dependencies. An alternative approach is the package gmplot, 
which we'll discuss next. First though, here is a list of common GeoPandas 
methods we've not yet covered.

+ `to_file()`: save `GeoDataFrame` to a geospatial file (.shp, .GEOjson, etc.)
+ `length()`: calculate the length of a geometry, useful for linestrings
+ `instersects()`: check if one geometry intersects with another
+ `contains()`: check if one geometry contains another
+ `buffer()`: create a buffer of specified size around a geometry
+ `equals()`: check if the CRS of two objects is the same
+ `is_valid()`: check for invalid geometries

### gmplot

#### Google Maps API

An API key is not necessary to create visuals with gmplot, but it is highly 
recommended. Without a key, any generated output will be dimmed and have a 
watermark.

![Example with no API key](images/spatial_data_visuals/no_api_ex.png)

The process to create an API key is very simple. Go 
[here](https://developers.google.com/maps) and click on **Get Started**. It 
requires some credit card information, but you start on a free trial with $300 
of credit. You will not be charged unless you select **activate full account**.

There are some configuration options you can set for your key. Google has many
different APIs, but gmplot only requires the *Maps Javascript API*.

#### Creating Plots with gmplot

gmplot is designed to mimic matplotlib, so the syntax should feel similar. The 
class `GoogleMapPlotter` provides the core functionality of the package.

```{python}
import gmplot

apikey = open('gmapKey.txt').read().strip() # read in API key

# plot map centered at NYC with zoom = 11
gmap = gmplot.GoogleMapPlotter(40.5665, -74.1697, 11, apikey=apikey)
```

**Note:** To render the classnotes on your computer, you will need to create 
the text file `gmapKey.txt` and store your Google Maps API key there.

The arguments include: 

+ The latitude and longitude of NYC
+ The level of zoom
+ API key (even if it's not used directly)
+ more optional arguments for further customization

#### Example with Zip Code Data

Let's display the largest zip code by area in NYC.

```{python}
gdf = gdf.to_crs(epsg=4326) # convert CRS to plot by latitude and longitude
largest_zip = gdf['geometry'][gdf['area'].idxmax()] # returns Shapely POLYGON

coords = list(largest_zip.exterior.coords) # unpack boundary coordinates
lats = [lat for lon, lat in coords]
lons = [lon for lon, lat in coords]

# plot shape of zip code
gmap.polygon(lats, lons, face_color='green', edge_color='blue', edge_width=3)

# gmap.draw('largest_zip.html')
```

After creating the plot, `gmap.draw('filename')` saves it as an HTML file in 
the current working directory, unless another location is specified. In the 
classnotes, all outputs will be shown as a PNG image.

![Largest NYC Zip Code by area](largest_zip.png)

Let's also plot the centriod of this zip code, and include a link to gmplot's 
documentation (in the classnotes this link won't work because the PNG is used).

```{python}
gdf.geometry = gdf['centroid'] # now working with new geometry column
gdf = gdf.to_crs(epsg=4326) # convert CRS to plot by latitude and longitude

centroid = gdf['centroid'][gdf['area'].idxmax()] # returns Shapely POINT

# plot the point with info window
gmap.marker(centroid.y, centroid.x, title='Center of Zip Code',
            info_window="<a href='https://github.com/gmplot/gmplot/wiki'>gmplot docs</a>")

# plot the polygon
gmap.polygon(lats, lons, face_color='green', edge_color='blue', edge_width=3)

# gmap.draw('zip_w_marker.html')
```

Here's the output:

![Center of largest NYC Zip Code](zip_w_marker.png)

#### Other Features of gmplot

+ `directions()`: draw directions from one point to another
+ `scatter()`: plot a collection of points
+ `heatmap()`: plot a heatmap
+ `enable_marker_dropping()`: click on map to create/remove markers
+ `from_geocode()`: use name of location instead of coordinates

You can also change the map type when you create an instance of 
`GoogleMapPlotter`. 

```{python}
# create hybrid type map
gmap = gmplot.GoogleMapPlotter(40.776676, -73.971321, 11.5, apikey=apikey,
                               map_type='hybrid')

# gmap.draw('nyc_hybrid.html')
```

### Summary

Geopandas is a powerful tool for handling spatial data and operations. It 
builds on regular Pandas by introducing two new data structures, the 
`GeoSeries` and `GeoDataFrame`. Under the hood, Shapely handles geometric 
operations.

The package gmplot is a simple yet dynamic tool that overlays spatial data onto 
interactive Google maps. It does so through the class `GoogleMapPlotter`, which 
offers an alternative to Geopandas' built in graphing methods for simple plots.
